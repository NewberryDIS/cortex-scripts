With the establishment on April 8, 1711 of Ribeirao do Carmo (present-day Mariana) by Antonio Albuquerque Coelho de Carvalho, first governor and captain-general of Minas Gerais, development of the area began in earnest: the founding of Villa Rica (Ouro Preto) followed on July 8, 1711, and Villa Real (Sabará) on July 16, 1711.  The religious, educational, and government institutions in these and other cites--including Paracatú, São Romaõ, Villa Nova da Rainha, Papagayo (Curvelho), and Pitanguy--are listed, as are the names of current officials and their salaries.

With the establishment on April 8, 1711 of Ribeirao do Carmo (present-day Mariana) by Antonio Albuquerque Coelho de Carvalho, first governor and captain-general of Minas Gerais, development of the area began in earnest: the founding of Villa Rica (Ouro Preto) followed on July 8, 1711, and Villa Real (Sabará) on July 16, 1711.  The religious, educational, and government institutions in these and other cites--including Paracatú, São Romaõ, Villa Nova da Rainha, Papagayo (Curvelho), and Pitanguy--are listed, as are the names of current officials and their salaries.  The author also gives details about the climate, geography, nearby villages, and army units assigned to the region.

With the establishment on April 8, 1711 of Ribeirao do Carmo (present-day Mariana) by Antonio Albuquerque Coelho de Carvalho, first governor and captain-general of Minas Gerais, development of the area began in earnest: the founding of Villa Rica (Ouro Preto) followed on July 8, 1711, and Villa Real (Sabará) on July 16, 1711.  The religious, educational, and government institutions in these and other cites--including Paracatú, São Romaõ, Villa Nova da Rainha, Papagayo (Curvelho), and Pitanguy--are listed, as are the names of current officials and their salaries.  The author also gives details about the climate, geography, nearby villages, and army units assigned to the region.
